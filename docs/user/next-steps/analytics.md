# Analytics

**Where can you get information to make future decisions?** JuiceboxDAO contributors have built out several tools for you to use:

## Dune Analytics

1. The [Juicebox Project Dashboard](https://dune.com/juicebox/v3) ([v1 here](https://dune.com/twodam/Juicebox-Projects)) gives a detailed look into your project's cashflows, payouts, tokens, NFTs, and other trends. Enter your project ID and desired resolution, and then click `Apply all parameters`.
2. The [Juicebox Portfolio Dashboard](https://dune.com/twodam/Juicebox-Portfolio) gives an overview of an individual wallet's interactions with various Juicebox projects.
3. The [Juicebox Protocol Overview](https://dune.com/twodam/Juicebox-Protocol-Overview) is self explanatory.

## Flipside

1. The [Snapshot Dashboard](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/snapshot-plus-data-ueqrnb) provides analytics on proposals, voters, and other trends for a Snapshot space.
