# Juicebox Language Revisions

We've updated the language we use to describe the Juicebox protocol several times, and as a result, our docs, our resources, and juicebox.money have grown inconsistent with each other. This makes the protocol more difficult to understand for new users. For example, the terms _funding target_, _distribution limit_, _overflow_, and _payout limit_ all refer to the same concept â€” how much ETH can be paid out from a project.

In [this PR to juicebox.money](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-interface/pull/3130) and [this PR to docs.juicebox.money](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs/pull/122), Juicebox protocol terminology has been updated to address these issues.[^1] The goal is to improve consistency, accuracy, and clarity, and to minimize jargon wherever possible.

To see the terms in context, read the updated [project guide](/user/project/). **We should consistently use the updated terms in content we make and messages we send.**

[^1]: The create flow on [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) has not been updated yet. Wraeth is working on this.
[^2]: Replace overflow with simple explanations. Overflow is the ETH available for redemption. Instead of saying a project has no overflow, you can say that it is using all of its ETH for payouts, or has no ETH.
