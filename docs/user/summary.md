## What is Juicebox?

Juicebox is an **Ethereum funding protocol** which can help you fund, operate, and scale your project on-chain.

It takes about 10 minutes to create a Juicebox project. Juicebox will help you:

- Crowdfund your project with ETH.
- Issue Project Tokens and Project NFTs to your supporters — and reserve a percentage of those Tokens/NFTs for you, your team, or a community stockpile.
- Build trust with *Cycles*. Cycles are a period of time (like 3 minutes, 2 years, or 14 days) that you can use to lock your Project's Rules. When you edit your rules, the edits get *queued* for next Cycle — instead of going into effect immediately, they go into effect when your next Cycle starts.
- Each cycle, compensate your team with automated ETH payouts. Payouts can be fixed ETH amounts, ETH amounts which adjust to USD values, or percentages of the total ETH available.
- Allow your supporters to redeem their Project Tokens/NFTs to get back a portion of the ETH in your project. This can be a full refund, a partial refund, or it can be turned off completely.
- Add an Edit Deadline, preventing last second edits to your Cycle and preventing rug pulls. With a 3 day Edit Deadline, your community is guaranteed 3 days to verify any queued edits.

When you create a Juicebox project, an *Owner NFT* is sent to your wallet, which is the only way to control that project — the project's rules are managed directly on the Ethereum blockchain, making your project transparent and uncensorable.
