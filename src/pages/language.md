# Proposed Juicebox Frontend Language Revisions

**Objective:** Communicate Juicebox protocol features as plainly as possible without obfuscating functionality.

## Cycle

The key change here is from "Funding Cycle" to **Cycle**. This is among the most unique Juicebox mechanisms, and may very well be the most powerful. We can rest more of the "complexity load" on this phrase, making other terms easier to explain. Cycles are a **length of time** during which **rules are locked**.

| Original Phrase | Revised Phrase | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Funding Cycle | Cycle | "Funding" doesn't add much to this understanding. |
| Funding Cycle Configuration | Cycle Rules | General term for hard-coded, contractual rules associated with a Cycle. |
| Funding Cycle Configuration | Project Settings | General term for project metadata and other settings which can be changed at any time. **These should be made distinct from contractual Cycle constraints.** |
| Reconfiguration | (Rule) Revision | "Reconfiguration" is a mouth-full, and doesn't convey much. |
| Reconfigured a Funding Cycle | Revised Cycle Rules | Same reasoning. |
| Reconfiguration Rules | Revision Deadline | A little clearer since we only use deadline-style ballots for now. Eventually, we can expand this concept to "Revision Constraints". |

## Payouts

We currently use the terms **Distributions**, **Payouts**, **Distribution Limit**, and **Funding Target**. No need to have four different terms for one concept.

| Original Phrase | Revised Phrase | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Distribution(s) | Payout(s) | Payout more clearly communicates that funds are being "paid out", and is no less general a term. |
| Distribution Limit | Payout Limit | Although we should try to minimize use of this term, "Payout Limit" is clearer (for the reasons mentioned above). |
| Funding Target | Payout Limit | Inconsistency between these two terms has repeatedly led to confusion for project creators. |

## Issuance

These terms are all over the place, but the underlying concepts are relatively simple. We should use a consistent naming schema to convey the simple relationship between them.

| Original Phrase | Revised Phrase | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial Mint Rate | Total Issuance Rate | "Initial" is confusing â€” you can change this number over time. Should be clear that this is about token issuance. |
| Contributor Rate | Payer Issuance Rate | "Contributor" is vague. "Issuance" for reason above. |
| Reserved Rate | Reserved Issuance Rate | Consistency with two preceding terms. |

## Permissions

By using the term "Admin", we can convey administrative permissions and create space for `JBOperatorStore` roles.

| Original Phrase | Revised Phrase | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project Owner | Project Admin | Conveys administrative permissions. Also makes it easier to explain operator permissions when/if implemented. We can still use "Project Creators" as a general term. |
| Project NFT | Admin NFT | To disambiguate with NFT rewards (which should be called Project NFTs). |
| Token Minting | Admin Token Minting | "Token Minting" is too generic. |

## Other

| Original Phrase | Revised Phrase | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NFTs | Project NFTs | To be consistent with "Project Tokens". |
| Discount Rate | Issuance Taper/Decay/Reduction Rate | Still figuring out the word choice, but "Discount Rate" has always been confusing and there's no particular reason to use it. |
| Redemption Rate | Redemption Curve | Redemption should be a toggle (which is how 90% of projects use it). If Redemptions are on, you can set a Redemption Curve. This alludes to its underlying technical nature: that of a bonding curve. |
| Payment Address | Project Payer Address | "Payment Address" is vague. |
