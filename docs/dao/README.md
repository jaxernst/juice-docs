# About JuiceboxDAO

JuiceboxDAO contributors build the Juicebox protocol and the ecosystem around it, enabling projects to raise thousands of ETH and to build robust communities around their treasuries and tokens.

JuiceboxDAO contributors build in the open â€” to participate, read the [contributing guide](contribute) and [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox). We have Discord Town Halls every Tuesday at 22:00 UTC. [Read about previous ones](/town-hall) or stop by and say hello!
