Notes:

- Events used for both Juicebox v1 and Juicebox v2 contracts include a `cv` (contracts version) property, which allows querying events for a specific contracts version.
- `project.id` is string concatenated from multiple properties. `projectId` represents an integer id of the project.
- Familiarize yourself with sample records of the various entities on [GraphLooker](https://graphlooker.com/explore?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgateway.thegraph.com%2Fapi%2F7ba063459ec88c336425c0847b9368a1%2Fsubgraphs%2Fid%2FFVmuv3TndQDNd2BWARV8Y27yuKKukryKXPzvAS5E7htC&e=ProtocolLog&efd=protocolLogs).
