## Felixander

**Resolved**. Felixander returned all 3.7109970336715117 ETH to [JuiceboxDAO v1](https://juicebox.money/p/juicebox) in transaction [`0x456a41c7902c949c4f2fe5f34e0b3798f8dfd2e447acc74a8707bf116a43c892`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x456a41c7902c949c4f2fe5f34e0b3798f8dfd2e447acc74a8707bf116a43c892).

### What Happened?

[felixander.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8488938161c9afa127e93fef6d3447051588664) was paid an extra 3.7109970336715117 ETH across two transactions:

- 1.790052343548078439 ETH in transaction [`0xda343747402c02463dfa67d724af25043764b7faa18d49e89f0bc9c5f1fdbbc1`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xda343747402c02463dfa67d724af25043764b7faa18d49e89f0bc9c5f1fdbbc1)
- 1.920944690123433335 ETH in transaction [`0x18c6285bfad884453f63cf927f53b65a126fa848bde404db733fa96c57cfd3c6`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x18c6285bfad884453f63cf927f53b65a126fa848bde404db733fa96c57cfd3c6)

### What Went Wrong?

The first extra payment was caused by a bug with Juicebox v1. As [Jango describes it](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/915334655144787998/1075044072164691988):

> aha. yeah i recognize this. it's a V1 bug recreated by:
> 
> - being in FC#X with funds still not distributed.
> - reconfiguring FC#X+1.
> - distributing funds from FC#X.
> 
> That distribute call creates a new FC that overwrites the reconfiguration. bug stumbled upon in Slice earlier on too.
> lets be mindful to distribute from V1 before calling reconfigure to it this next time around.
> seems like it'll be among our last V1 reconfigures anyways.

This rolled over into a second extra payment due to the multisig failure [decribed below](#multisig-failure).

### Solving This

Felixander will have to transfer 3.7109970336715117 ETH back to [JuiceboxDAO v1](https://juicebox.money/p/juicebox) (v1p1) via the `addToBalance` transaction. [I shared a video tutorial detailing the steps to do this here](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/915334655144787998/1083878280861585448).

## Juicebox Rewards

### What Happened?

[JBP-330](https://www.jbdao.org/p/330) approved a one-time payout of $3,000 to [Juicebox referral](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/410) (v2p410), which was sent in transaction [`0x95ec31ba8a78a18ecf0934d9c02513f8373bd02296acfecec233c99dc9fa02df`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x95ec31ba8a78a18ecf0934d9c02513f8373bd02296acfecec233c99dc9fa02df).

Juicebox referral then received an extra $3,000 payout of 1.8119844678505186 ETH in transaction [`0x3e3f920800b1b805fd2cbc932678a58e2e3765105e462659630e80def698d082`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3e3f920800b1b805fd2cbc932678a58e2e3765105e462659630e80def698d082) (see event #113).

### What Went Wrong?

What was originally supposed to be a one-time payment rolled over into a second payment due to the multisig failure [decribed below](#multisig-failure).

### Solving This

I queued a transaction from the multisig which owns this project ([`0x7A05B46bFd5f26F3E40a28E4fE49DE338b63235E`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7A05B46bFd5f26F3E40a28E4fE49DE338b63235E)) to pay out 1.8119844678505186 ETH to v2p1 with `preferAddToBalance` enabled. After this takes effect, the payouts will have to be distributed from the project, and a new cycle will be queued to remove the payout.

## WAGMI

### What Happened?

WAGMI Studios received 3 $8,500 payouts approved by [JBP-314](https://www.jbdao.org/p/314):

1. v1p1 -> v1p5 @ [`0x9469aa6d691ba9db62cdc87f763827f6b44b323992042a25dee7ac5248c7da8f`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9469aa6d691ba9db62cdc87f763827f6b44b323992042a25dee7ac5248c7da8f)
2. v2p1 -> v2p387 @ [`0x07b07428942da6dc869d8b031ac235969f0bc4ad6bc7e317e9806ae13e0d931c`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x07b07428942da6dc869d8b031ac235969f0bc4ad6bc7e317e9806ae13e0d931c)
3. v2p1 -> v2p387 @ [`0x3696159562c1ec9bccaf11272ee8ed664c2b9c91d10c8de98d14259ec2ab8ccc`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3696159562c1ec9bccaf11272ee8ed664c2b9c91d10c8de98d14259ec2ab8ccc)

But then, due to a bookkeeping error, WAGMI studios received 2 unapproved $8,500 payouts:

1. 4.965342738066261773 ETH — v2p1 -> v2p387 @ [`0x95ec31ba8a78a18ecf0934d9c02513f8373bd02296acfecec233c99dc9fa02df`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x95ec31ba8a78a18ecf0934d9c02513f8373bd02296acfecec233c99dc9fa02df) (log 185)
2. 5.133955976086274861 ETH — v2p1 -> v2p387 @ [`0x3e3f920800b1b805fd2cbc932678a58e2e3765105e462659630e80def698d082`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3e3f920800b1b805fd2cbc932678a58e2e3765105e462659630e80def698d082) (log 122)

Summing to 10.099298714152536634 ETH. Some of this ETH was left in the @wagmi-studios project, and some of the ETH was paid out to sagekellyn.eth and mieos.eth in the following transactions:

1. 4.175902021980110846 ETH — v2p387 @ [`0x6e2c3afaaad12d49dc224494be698e5abe152631486796a7c8bed537f4a1792b`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6e2c3afaaad12d49dc224494be698e5abe152631486796a7c8bed537f4a1792b):
	1. 3.492043502119130738 ETH -> sagekellyn.eth
	2. 0.582007251032196916 ETH -> mieos.eth
	3. 0.101851268828783192 ETH -> Fees
2. 4.542612757707288829 ETH — v2p387 @ [`0xfd00bf7cd209f9c7323ba868ac950a8869ca275f90727e21cac7d317b98160f3`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfd00bf7cd209f9c7323ba868ac950a8869ca275f90727e21cac7d317b98160f3):
	1. 3.798700563303292015 ETH -> sagekellyn.eth
	2. 0.633116761289184890 ETH -> mieos.eth
	3. 0.110795433114811923 ETH -> Fees

### Solving This

1. sagekellyn.eth will have to transfer 7.290744065422422753 ETH to v2p1 via `addToBalance`.
2. mieos.eth will have to transfer 1.215124012321381806 ETH to v2p1 `addToBalance`.
3. @wagmi-studios will have to pay out 1.380783934465136959 ETH to v2p1 with `preferAddToBalance` set to true, or pay out the ETH to another wallet which can transfer it to v2p1.

I'll get on a call with Sage and Mieos to figure out the best way to execute this.

## Multisig Failure

The multisig must queue, verify, sign, and execute any edits to JuiceboxDAO's projects at least 3 days before the next cycle starts for those edits to take effect.

On 2023-02-21, The multisig had [several transactions queued](https://discord.com/channels/775859454780244028/881204325374906388/1077729195305738301) and got them signed towards the end of this period, with ~4 hours left until the edit deadline. At the time, gas prices were high. @twodam shared several messages to this effect:

> all signed, can be executed when gas price are low @jango 
> 
> now it costs ~$500 to execute both reconfigure txns

Nobody executed the transactions before the edit deadline.
