#### Welcome to the Juicebox User Docs!

Juicebox is an **Ethereum funding protocol** which can help you fund, operate, and scale your project on-chain. You can see how people are using it on [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) — it's an extremely powerful tool for building trust with your supporters, funding your project, and then running your project effectively.

It takes about 10 minutes to create a Juicebox project, which you can use to:

- Crowdfund your project with ETH.
- Issue tokens and NFTs to your supporters — and reserve a percentage of those tokens/NFTs for you, your team, or a community stockpile.
- Build trust with *Cycles*.
	- With unlocked cycles, you can edit your project's rules at any time.
	- With locked cycles, you can choose period of time (like 3 minutes, 2 years, or 14 days) for your rules to be locked. When you edit your rules, the edits get *queued* for next Cycle — instead of going into effect immediately, they go into effect when your next Cycle starts.
- Each cycle, compensate your team with automated payouts.
	- Payouts can be fixed ETH amounts, ETH based on USD values, or percentages of all the ETH in your project.
- Allow your supporters to redeem their tokens or NFTs to get back a portion of the ETH in your project. This can be a full refund, a partial refund, or it can be turned off completely.
- Add a deadline for edits, making last second edits to your Cycle impossible (and preventing rug pulls). With a 3-day deadline, your community is guaranteed 3 days to verify any queued edits.

When you create your Juicebox project, an *Owner NFT* will be sent to your wallet, which is the only way to control your project — the project's rules are managed directly on the Ethereum blockchain, making your project independent, transparent, and uncensorable. 

You can change these rules over time, making Juicebox very effective for scaling communities. As your community grows, your project can grow with it.

#### How do I start?

You can [Contact Onboarding](https://juicebox.money/contact) or join the [JuiceboxDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox) — DAO members will answer your questions and help you to deploy your project. Or, if you feel confident, you can [deploy your project now](https://juicebox.money/create) — if you have questions about project parameters, double check the guide for [Configuring Your Project](configuration/).

We also have a [Goerli Testnet version of Juicebox](https://goerli.juicebox.money). If you need Goerli ETH, ask us.
